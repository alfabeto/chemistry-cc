![Ionisation energ. from H to Ca(kJ p mole)](http://www.chemguide.co.uk/atoms/properties/ieshtoca.GIF)

First ionisation energy shows periodicity. That means that it varies in a repetitive way as you move
through the Periodic Table. For example, look at the pattern from Li to Ne, and then compare it with 
the identical pattern from Na to Ar. These variations in first ionisation energy can all be explained 
in terms of the structures of the atoms involved.
