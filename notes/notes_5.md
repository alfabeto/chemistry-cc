First ionisation energy shows periodicity. That means that it varies in a repetitive way as you move
through the Periodic Table. For example, look at the pattern from Li to Ne, and then compare it with 
the identical pattern from Na to Ar. These variations in first ionisation energy can all be explained 
in terms of the structures of the atoms involved.

##Ionic bonding in sodium chloride

The sodium has lost an electron, so it no longer has equal numbers of electrons and protons. Because
it has one more proton than electron, it has a charge of 1+. If electrons are lost from an atom, 
positive ions are formed.
Positive ions are sometimes called **cations**.
The chlorine has gained an electron, so it now has one more electron than proton. It therefore has a 
charge of 1-. If electrons are gained by an atom, negative ions are formed.
A negative ion is sometimes called an **anion**.
