# Prototypes - doing models, export to Lua, print in LOVE

todo:
- export constants from nucleus.py to doc/txt/latex etc.
- load into Lua
- print model (below info for it) in LOVE

##If the particles have the same energy
![pic1](http://www.chemguide.co.uk/atoms/properties/efield1.gif "Proton, Neutron, Electron + charged plates/same energy")

If beams of the three sorts of particles, all with the same energy, are
passed between two electrically charged plates:

- Protons are deflected on a curved path towards the negative plate.
- Electrons are deflected on a curved path towards the positive plate.
- The amount of deflection is exactly the same in the electron beam as 
  the proton beam if the energies are the same - but, of course, it is 
  in the opposite direction.
- Neutrons continue in a straight line.

##If the particles have the same speeds
![pic2](http://www.chemguide.co.uk/atoms/properties/efield2.gif "Proton, Neutron, Electron + charged plates/same speed")

If beams of the three sorts of particles, all with the same speed, are 
passed between two electrically charged plates:

- Protons are deflected on a curved path towards the negative plate.
- Electrons are deflected on a curved path towards the positive plate.
- If the electrons and protons are travelling with the same speed, then
  the lighter electrons are deflected far more strongly than the heavier
  protons.
- Neutrons continue in a straight line.
