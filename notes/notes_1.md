In the name of understanding world, I've just make decision to learn Chemistry.
And this repo is for chemistry gymnastics. I always was more familiar with 
Physics etc., so this gonna be some challenge. And also: Crash Course is great.

#The Nucleus

    proton[1] (+ charge) > heavy(mass)
    
    neutron[2] (~= proton)(neutral charge)
    
    electron[3] (- charge) > 
    ~ 800 times smaller than proton & neutron(mass)

Proton & neutron are inside of Nucleus and they are called nucleons (nucleus
components). Electrons are around nucleus. Number of protons defines with 
which atom we'are dealing.

##Relative Atomic Mass
protons + neutrons 
  
##Mass Numbers
Nucleus = protons + neutrons

##Isotpe 
[i-so-tope]*noun*
ISO-SAME TOPE-PLACE
different neutron number
giving diffrent mass number
